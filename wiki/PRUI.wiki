#summary Description of the Pre-Rendered User Interfaces design technique.

= Introduction =

*PRUI*, or Pre-Rendered User Interface, is a design technique intended to reduce the size of the trusted computing base of a software artifact (e.g. !VoteBox).  By generating most of the user interface ahead of time, we reduce the amount of run-time UI code that needs to be trusted for the system to operate correctly.

In !VoteBox, we pre-render ballots using the [PrepToolGuide Ballot Creator] (or "ballot prep tool"). The !VoteBox booth software uses the pre-rendered ballot, in the form of a ZIP archive containing only PNG graphics and XML files describing how to show those graphics, to present an interface to the user. 

The PRUI technique as applied to voting was pioneered by Ka-Ping Kee in his [http://pvote.org Pvote] voting system project.
