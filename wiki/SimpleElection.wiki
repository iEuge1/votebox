= Running a Simple !VoteBox election =

A "simple" election is one featuring only [Supervisor Supervisor] and VoteBox booth machines (encryption is optional as well).  Any configuration files _without_ `USE_COMMIT_CHALLENGE_MODEL` set to `true` can be used in a SimpleElection (they must, however, be consistent between Supervisor and !VoteBoxes).  The [PRUI PreRendered] `ballot.zip` used in this example can be found [http://votebox.cs.rice.edu/images/instrux/small/presidential-only-simple.bal.zip here]; the [PrepToolGuide Ballot Creator] `.bal` file used to generate it is [http://votebox.googlecode.com/files/presidential-only.bal here].

== Instructions ==
 * Place supervisor.jar & votebox.jar on seperate machines.  Any number of each may be in use, provided there is no more than one per machine and at least one of each on the network.
 * Start the supervisor and votebox jars
  * Instructions may be found [Supervisor here] and [VoteBox here], respectively.
 * While the auditorium network is being established and discovery is ongoing, you will see the following screens on supervisors and voteboxes respectively.

 * When a Supervisor discovers its first !VoteBox the screen changes to one similar to this.

 * You then activate a console (which will number all !VoteBoxes), select a ballot, and open the polls.
